# Detect_Changes
Siamese network method - Detect the changes from the two given input images. 


VGG19:
           
           
           VGG-19 is a convolutional neural network that is 19 layers deep. You can load a pre-trained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. 
           Using VGG19 pre-trained model as the model. And sending two input images to the same model but separate like good in model1 and bad in model2 and finally subtracting both model.

            Good:
